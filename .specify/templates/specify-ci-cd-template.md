# CI/CD Feature Specification: [CI/CD FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-ci-cd-feature-name]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Goal
[Clearly state the primary objective of this CI/CD feature. E.g., "Automate the build, test, and deployment process for the Pixelog application to a staging environment."]

## Scope

### In-Scope
- [List what this CI/CD feature WILL cover. E.g., "Automated unit and integration testing on every push to `main` and feature branches."]
- [E.g., "Automated deployment of the backend and frontend to a staging environment upon successful merge to `main`."]

### Out-of-Scope
- [List what this CI/CD feature WILL NOT cover. E.g., "Deployment to production environment."]
- [E.g., "Performance testing within the CI/CD pipeline."]

## Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **CI-FR-001**: The CI pipeline MUST automatically trigger on every push to `main` and feature branches.
- **CI-FR-002**: The CI pipeline MUST execute all unit and integration tests for both backend and frontend.
- **CI-FR-003**: The CI pipeline MUST report test results and code coverage status.
- **CI-FR-004**: The CD pipeline MUST automatically deploy the application to the staging environment upon successful completion of the CI pipeline on the `main` branch.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **CI-NFR-001**: The CI pipeline MUST complete within [X] minutes for typical changes.
- **CI-NFR-002**: The CD pipeline MUST ensure zero-downtime deployments to the staging environment.
- **CI-NFR-003**: The CI/CD system MUST provide clear logs and status updates for each pipeline run.

## Triggers
- **Code Push**: Automatically run CI pipeline on `main` and all feature branches.
- **Pull Request**: Automatically run CI pipeline on pull request creation and updates.

## Environments
- **Staging**: An environment for testing new features before production deployment.

## Success Criteria
- All automated tests pass consistently.
- Deployments to staging are successful and without manual intervention.
- Code changes are reflected in the staging environment within [Y] minutes of merging to `main`.

## Clarifications
[Use this section to capture any ambiguities or open questions that arise during the specification phase. E.g., "What cloud provider will be used for hosting the staging environment?"]
