# CI/CD Implementation Plan: [CI/CD FEATURE NAME]

**Branch**: `[###-ci-cd-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link to CI/CD spec]
**Input**: CI/CD feature specification from `/specs/[###-ci-cd-feature-name]/spec.md`

## Overview
[Summarize the CI/CD pipeline's purpose and high-level flow. E.g., "This plan outlines the implementation of a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the build, test, and deployment of the Pixelog application to a Google Cloud Run staging environment."]

## Technical Context

**CI/CD Platform**: [e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Azure DevOps]
**Containerization**: [e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, None]
**Deployment Target**: [e.g., Google Cloud Run, AWS EC2, Vercel, Heroku]
**Testing Frameworks**: [e.g., Jest, Vitest, Cypress]
**Code Quality Tools**: [e.g., ESLint, Prettier, SonarQube]

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Build Stage
- **Description**: Compiles source code and creates build artifacts.
- **Steps**:
    1.  Checkout repository code.
    2.  Install Node.js dependencies for backend and frontend.
    3.  Build backend application (if applicable).
    4.  Build frontend application (e.g., `npm run build`).
    5.  (Optional) Build Docker images for backend and frontend.
- **Artifacts**: Compiled code, Docker images (if containerized).

### 2. Test Stage
- **Description**: Executes automated tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
- **Steps**:
    1.  Run backend unit tests (`cd backend && npm test`).
    2.  Run frontend unit tests (`cd frontend && npm test`).
    3.  Run integration tests (if applicable).
    4.  (Optional) Run linting and code style checks.
- **Success Criteria**: All tests pass, code coverage meets defined thresholds.

### 3. Deploy Stage (Staging Environment)
- **Description**: Deploys the application to the staging environment.
- **Steps**:
    1.  Authenticate with cloud provider (e.g., Google Cloud, AWS).
    2.  Deploy backend service (e.g., to Cloud Run, EC2).
    3.  Deploy frontend service (e.g., to Cloud Run, Vercel).
    4.  Verify deployment health checks.
- **Target Environment**: Staging
- **Triggers**: Successful completion of Test Stage on `main` branch.

## Configuration Files
- **GitHub Actions**: `.github/workflows/main.yml`
- **Docker**: `Dockerfile.backend`, `Dockerfile.frontend`
- **Deployment Scripts**: `deploy-staging.sh`

## Rollback Strategy
[Describe how to revert to a previous working version in case of deployment failure. E.g., "Automated rollback to the last successful deployment version using platform-specific features (e.g., Cloud Run revisions)."]

## Monitoring and Alerting
[Outline how the CI/CD pipeline and deployed application will be monitored. E.g., "Integrate with Slack for build failure notifications."]

## Testing Strategy for CI/CD
[Describe how the CI/CD pipeline itself will be tested. E.g., "Use a dedicated `ci-test` branch to validate workflow changes before merging to `main`."]

## Progress Tracking

**Phase Status**:
- [ ] Phase 0: Initial setup (workflow file creation)
- [ ] Phase 1: Build stage implemented
- [ ] Phase 2: Test stage implemented
- [ ] Phase 3: Deploy stage implemented (staging)
- [ ] Phase 4: Rollback and monitoring configured
- [ ] Phase 5: CI/CD testing strategy implemented
