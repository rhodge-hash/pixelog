# Feature Specification: Embedding Service Implementation

## 1. Overview
This feature introduces an embedding service responsible for generating vector embeddings for knowledge assets. These embeddings will be used to facilitate efficient and accurate semantic search within the Pixelog application. The primary goal is to transform diverse knowledge sources into a machine-readable format that captures their semantic meaning, enabling advanced search capabilities beyond simple keyword matching.

## 2. User Stories
* As a user, I want knowledge assets to be processed into embeddings so that I can perform semantic searches.
* As a developer, I want a dedicated service for generating embeddings so that the search functionality is decoupled and scalable.

## 3. Technical Design
### 3.1. Architecture Changes
A new `Embedding Service` will be introduced in the `backend/src/services` directory. This service will be responsible for interacting with an external or internal embedding model (e.g., a pre-trained transformer model). It will expose methods to generate embeddings for given text or data. The `Search Service` will depend on this `Embedding Service` to create embeddings for indexing and query processing.

### 3.2. API Changes
No direct API changes are expected for the client-facing API. The `Embedding Service` will primarily be an internal service consumed by other backend services, specifically the `Search Service`.

### 3.3. Data Model Changes
The `KnowledgeAsset` model will be updated to include a new field to store the generated vector embedding. This field will likely be an array of numbers or a similar data structure suitable for vector storage and retrieval.

### 3.4. Component-Level Design
- Q: What are the target latency and throughput for embedding generation for a 1MB text asset? → A: Processing a 1MB file requires chunking it into smaller pieces, as most embedding models have input token limits. You would then embed each chunk in a batched approach to maximize throughput.

#### Embedding Service (`backend/src/services/embedding-service.js`)
*   **`generateEmbedding(data: string | Buffer): Promise<number[]>`**: This method will take raw text or binary data of a knowledge asset, preprocess it (including chunking for large assets) as required by the embedding model, and return a vector embedding (array of numbers). Batch processing of chunks will be employed to maximize throughput.
*   **`initializeModel(): Promise<void>`**: A method to load and initialize the embedding model. This could be a local model or an API client for a remote service.

#### Search Service (`backend/src/services/search-service.js`)
*   Will be modified to utilize the `Embedding Service` to generate embeddings for incoming knowledge assets before indexing them.
*   Will also use the `Embedding Service` to generate embeddings for search queries to perform vector similarity search.

#### Knowledge Asset Model (`backend/src/models/knowledge-asset.js`)
*   Add a new field, e.g., `embedding: { type: [Number], dimension: 384, dtype: 'float32', required: false }`, to store the vector embedding.

- Q: What are the expected failure modes for the external embedding model (if used), and how should the service handle them? → A: Network or API failures. The service should implement retries and rate-limiting.

- Q: How should the system handle cases where embedding generation fails for a knowledge asset? → A: Gracefully retry, log the error, and notify.

*   **Reliability & Availability**: The embedding service should aim for high uptime and rapid recovery in case of failures.

## 4. Security Considerations
*   **Data Privacy**: Ensure that the data sent to the embedding model (if external) does not contain sensitive information or is appropriately anonymized.
*   **Access Control**: The embedding service should only be accessible by authorized internal services.
*   **Model Security**: If using a local model, ensure its integrity and prevent tampering. If using an external API, secure API keys and credentials.

## 5. Performance Considerations
*   **Embedding Generation Latency**: The time taken to generate embeddings for large assets should be optimized. This will involve chunking large assets and processing them in batches to maximize throughput. Consider asynchronous processing for asset ingestion.
*   **Scalability**: The embedding service should be designed to handle a growing number of assets and search queries. Consider horizontal scaling for the service.
*   **Resource Utilization**: Monitor CPU/GPU and memory usage, especially if using computationally intensive embedding models.

## 6. Test Plan
*   **Unit Tests**:
    *   `embedding-service.test.js`: Test `generateEmbedding` with various inputs (text, different data types, edge cases). Test `initializeModel` for correct model loading.
    *   `search-service.test.js`: Verify that the search service correctly calls the embedding service during indexing and querying.
    *   `knowledge-asset.test.js`: Test the updated data model for storing embeddings.
*   **Integration Tests**:
    *   Test the flow from asset ingestion (which triggers embedding generation) to search query using embeddings.
*   **Performance Tests**:
    *   Measure the time taken to generate embeddings for assets of varying sizes.
    *   Measure the impact of embedding generation on overall asset ingestion throughput.

## 7. Deployment and Operations
*   The `Embedding Service` will be deployed as part of the backend application.
*   Monitoring will include metrics for embedding generation time, success rates, and resource utilization.
*   Logging will capture any errors or warnings during embedding generation.
*   Consider environment variables for configuring the embedding model (e.g., API endpoint, model path).
*   Implement retry mechanisms and rate-limiting for interactions with external embedding models to handle network or API failures gracefully.
*   For embedding generation failures, the system should gracefully retry, log the error, and notify relevant systems or administrators.

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: What is the specific data type and maximum dimension for the vector embedding in the `KnowledgeAsset` model? → A: float32 and 384.

## 8. Open Questions / Future Work
*   Which specific embedding model will be used (e.g., OpenAI embeddings, Sentence Transformers, custom model)?
*   How will the embedding model be deployed (e.g., local, cloud API, containerized)?
*   What is the strategy for re-embedding existing assets if the embedding model changes or improves?
*   Consider different embedding strategies for various data types (e.g., text, code, images).
