# Research for Embedding Service Implementation

## 1. Embedding Model Selection

### Decision: [To be determined]
### Rationale: [To be determined]
### Alternatives considered:
*   OpenAI Embeddings (API-based, potentially high cost, good performance)
*   Sentence Transformers (local deployment, open-source, flexible, resource-intensive)
*   Custom pre-trained models (requires expertise, fine-tuning)

## 2. Embedding Model Deployment Strategy

### Decision: [To be determined]
### Rationale: [To be determined]
### Alternatives considered:
*   Local deployment within the backend service (simpler, direct control, resource implications)
*   Cloud API (managed service, scalability, cost implications)
*   Containerized deployment (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes for scalability and isolation)

## 3. Re-embedding Strategy for Existing Assets

### Decision: [To be determined]
### Rationale: [To be determined]
### Alternatives considered:
*   Manual re-embedding (triggered by administrator)
*   Automated re-embedding (scheduled job, event-driven)
*   Lazy re-embedding (on-demand when asset is accessed or searched)

## 4. Embedding Strategies for Diverse Data Types

### Decision: [To be determined]
### Rationale: [To be determined]
### Alternatives considered:
*   Text: Standard text embedding models
*   Code: Specialized code embedding models (e.g., CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT)
*   Images: Image embedding models (e.g., CLIP, ResNet features)
*   Unified approach: A single model capable of handling multiple modalities (if available and feasible)
