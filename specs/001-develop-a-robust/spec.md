# Feature Specification: Develop a robust, open-source application named Pixelog

**Feature Branch**: `001-develop-a-robust`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Develop a robust, open-source application named Pixelog (not Memvid), serving as a "SQLite-meets-YouTube for LLM memories." It will store diverse knowledge sources (text, images, audio, micro-videos) as compressed, encrypted video files (QR code streams) that are portable, streamable, and semantically searchable. The application will be built using JavaScript (Node.js for backend, browser/Wasm for client) and command-line tools."

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: What is the primary authentication mechanism for users? ‚Üí A: Local file/key access
- Q: What is the expected maximum size of a single knowledge asset? ‚Üí A: 10 - 100 MB
- Q: Should the system support multiple users with different access levels (e.g., admin, user), or will all users have the same permissions? ‚Üí A: All users have the same permissions
- Q: How should the system handle a search query that returns a very large number of results? ‚Üí A: Return only the top N results
- Q: What level of portability is required for the stored data? ‚Üí A: Self-contained file (e.g., a single `.zip` file)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to store various types of information (text, images, audio, videos) in a secure and searchable way, so that I can easily retrieve and use my knowledge assets.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a piece of text, **When** I input it into Pixelog, **Then** it should be stored as a compressed, encrypted, and searchable video file.
2. **Given** a stored knowledge asset, **When** I search for it using keywords, **Then** the relevant asset should be returned.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the input data is corrupted?
- How does the system handle very large files?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to input text, images, audio, and micro-videos.
- **FR-002**: System MUST compress and encrypt all stored data.
- **FR-003**: System MUST store data as video files composed of QR code streams.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a semantic search capability for all stored data.
- **FR-005**: Stored data MUST be portable as a self-contained file and streamable.
- **FR-006**: The application MUST be open-source.
- **FR-007**: The application MUST have a Node.js backend.
- **FR-008**: The application MUST have a browser/Wasm client.
- **FR-009**: The application MUST have command-line tools.
- **FR-010**: System MUST use local file/key access for authentication.
- **FR-011**: System MUST support knowledge assets up to 100 MB in size.
- **FR-012**: All users MUST have the same permissions.
- **FR-013**: Search queries MUST return only the top N results. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the value of N?]


### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Knowledge Asset**: Represents a single piece of information stored in Pixelog. Attributes include: content (text, image, audio, or video), metadata, and the compressed/encrypted video file.
- **User**: Represents a user of the Pixelog system, authenticated via local file/key access.
